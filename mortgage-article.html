        <p>
            - Housing loans in Japan are typically used for purchasing, renovating, or refinancing a home. <br>
            - General prerequisites for loan applicants include age (20-69 years old), years of continuous employment in
            Japan (2-3 years), and minimum yearly income (JPY 2,000,000–5,000,000). <br>
            - The property should comply with the Building Standard Act and have land ownership. <br>
            - Loan amounts can go up to JPY 100,000,000 or JPY 500,000,000, covering 70-80% of the purchase amount or up
            to
            90% of the assessed home equity. <br>
            - Loan terms range from 1 to 35 years, and various interest rate options are available. <br>
            - Repayment methods include principal and equal interest, capital equal, and bonus repayment. <br>
            - Some loans require a guarantor and guarantee charge, while others may not. <br>
            - Group credit life insurance premiums are often included in loan interest. <br>
            - Handling fees vary by financial institution. <br><br><br>

            **For Foreigners Applying for a Housing Loan:** <br>
            - Japanese financial institutions prefer non-migratory applicants, such as those with Permanent Residency
            status, Japanese spouses, or a residency period eligible for Permanent Residency. <br>
            - Major banks and trust banks often require Permanent Residency status or a Japanese spouse for loan
            eligibility. <br><br><br>

            **Financial Institutions Handling Housing Loans for Foreigners:** <br>
            - Some financial institutions, including PRESTIA (SMBC Trust Bank Ltd.), Shinsei Bank, Suruga Bank, Bank of
            China offer housing loans to foreigners residing in Japan. <br><br><br>

            **Investment Property Loans for Foreigners:** <br>
            - Investment property loans are available for non-residents in Japan looking to purchase real estate for
            investment, asset management, or second homes. <br>
            - LTV (Loan to Value Ratio) for investment property loans is often lower than housing loans. <br><br><br>

            **Financial Institutions Handling Investment Property Loans for Foreigners:** <br>
            - PRESTIA (SMBC Trust Bank Ltd.) offers investment property loans without requiring Permanent Residency
            status.
            <br>
            - Shinsei Investment & Finance Limited, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications Limited also provide such
            loans, each with varying requirements. <br><br><br>

            **Financial Institutions Handling Loans for Non-Resident Foreigners:** <br>
            - Some financial institutions, like Shinsei Investment & Finance Limited and ORIX Asia Limited, provide
            mortgage
            loans for overseas investors living in specific regions (e.g., Hong Kong, Taiwan). <br><br>

            **Financial Institutions Providing Loans Regardless of Nationality:** <br>
            - United Overseas Bank Limited and Bank of China offer investment property loans to individuals of any
            nationality, but language skills may be required. <br><br>

            **Financial Institutions that Require Establishing a Corporation in Japan:** <br>
            - Non-residents in Japan may establish a corporation in Japan to qualify for a loan from institutions like
            Shinsei Investment & Finance Limited and Shinhan Bank Japan. <br>

        <p>Always check with the specific real estate agency for details, requirements, terms, and conditions when
            applying for a home mortgage loan in Japan. Additionally, having a real estate agency like Puri Cross U to
            assist
            can be valuable in navigating the process.</p>
