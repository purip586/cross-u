        <small style="opacity: 0.5;">By Puri, on 3rd Sep 2023</small><br><br><br>

        Step 1: Assemble Your Real Estate Team <br>
        - Find experienced professionals who know the Tokyo property market, lending options, and your financial
        goals.<br>
        - Consider working with agents to assist you. <br><br>

        Step 2: Initial Consultation <br>
        - Clarify your property requirements, such as size, location, budget, and other needs. <br>
        - Get feedback from experts to set realistic goals and expectations. <br><br>

        Step 3: Loan Pre-Approval <br>
        - Understand loan options, borrowing limits, down payment requirements, and monthly repayment costs. <br>
        - Collaborate with property professionals to find the best mortgage deals. <br><br>

        Step 4: Find the Right Property <br>
        - Begin your property search once you've defined your goals, budgets, and loan limits. <br>
        - Tokyo offers diverse properties, so work closely with your team to find value deals that make financial sense.
        <br><br>

        Step 5: Conduct Due Diligence <br>
        - Before making an offer, conduct due diligence, which may take days to weeks. <br>
        - Review property's land registry, title deeds, debts, and liens. <br>
        - Consider hiring a lawyer or property inspector if needed. <br><br>

        Step 6: Make an Offer and Negotiate <br>
        - Make an offer to the seller, who may accept, reject, or counteroffer. <br>
        - Negotiation and seller's availability can take days to weeks. <br>
        - Having an experienced team is crucial during this stage. <br><br>

        Step 7: Sign the Contract <br>
        - If your offer is accepted, sign a contract and pay an initial deposit. <br>
        - The contract outlines terms, including purchase price, payment schedule, and closing date. <br><br>

        Step 8: Closing <br>
        - On the closing date, pay the remaining purchase price, taxes, and agent fees. <br>
        - The seller transfers the property to you, and you receive legal ownership. <br><br>

        Step 9: Register the Property <br>
        - Register the property with the local government and obtain a property registration certificate. <br>
        - A professional, often introduced by your bank or real estate agent, can assist with this step. <br><br>

        <p>In conclusion, buying a property in Tokyo can take several weeks to months, depending on complexity and
            availability. Start by assembling a reliable team like Puri Cross u agents to guide you through the process
